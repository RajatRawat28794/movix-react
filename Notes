# PROJECT SET_UP & API CONFIGURATION & CALLING:
_________________________________________________


1. npm create vite@latest 
to be free from unneccesary code.
2. https://gist.github.com/ShariqAnsari88/09dbadfd81c41b399a30f6eb9f1f9548 and search package.json
3. Copy and paste in package.json.
4. npm install
5. Again go to gist link and copy index.scss file
 and paste inside index.css and rename it with scss.

6. remove unwanted line from app.jsx

7. copy images from this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W1Z8rPPZ4w7clT5jPxzeHkZYhaPJBPIy/view and paste inside assets fiolder.s

8. copy movix-logo.png file into public folder.

9. Now go to index.html and change at line no 5 with movix-logo.png

10. TMDB API Setup now - AXIOSs 

11. https://www.themoviedb.org/signup Register yourself here.
 username: rajat.rawat
 pwd: Devansh@1234
now go to settings-> API down below

12. now create .env file to save api token value.

13. create utils folder inside src and create api.js file 
and axios and base_URL

14. whenever we do changes in env file , we must restart our server application.

15. Why 2 times api call in network tab ?
because , in main.jsx--> we have strictmode which checks or confirm, is api coming correct or not ?
If we remove strictmode , then api will be called only once.

16. REDUX TOOL KITs

# REDUX SETUP & CONFIGURATION:
_____________________________________
Create a Redux Store
-----------------------
1. create store folder inside src
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/v--> redux toolkit & react-redux.
2. Study only from Quick start.
2.1 create redux store & copy from their site.
2.2 Create store.js file inside store folder and paste copied code into it.
2.3 Now, we created store and want to connect with react app and now goto main.jsx file

Provide the Redux Store to React
---------------------------------
Do import store  & provider into main.jsx -> line no 5,6.
Now wrap App component inside provider, and provider takes props actually so we simply pass store value inside it. line no 9 to 11. Now close main.jsx


Create a Redux State Slice
---------------------------
lets suppose, In our application, there will be many pages like home page, movie page.
Now if we want to create slice for each page ? means want to create main state. eg, Home se related global state ek object me honi chahiye,
movie se related ek object honi chahiye, uske liye slice hoti hai.
agar global state use ni honi, to global slice can create.

1. now create slice file into store folder name homSlice.js
2. now copy whole code from there and paste in homeSlice.js
3. now goto store.js, and import the created slice - homeSlice
4. Now go back to app.js, before we need to google dev tools to test is our store working fine or not ?
5. install redux dev tools
6. now open redux dev tools from inspection.
7. Store.js me jo reducer ke andar key di thi home karke , wo hume redux toolkit me state pe click krke dikhegi , check screenshot i have attached.
8. there u will see 2 values line 5 to 7 in homeSlice.js
